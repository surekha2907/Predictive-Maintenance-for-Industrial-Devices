# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Devices
Predictive maintenance plays a vital role in ensuring the smooth operation of industrial machinery while minimizing downtime and costs associated with unexpected failures. This project aims to enhance predictive maintenance for industrial devices through advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques.

# Parameters
1. UDI (Unique Device Identifier): A unique identifier for each device.
2. Product ID: An identifier specific to the product.
3. Type: Categorized as L, M, or H representing low (50% of all products), medium (30%), and high (20%) product quality variants, each with a variant-specific serial number.
4. Air Temperature [K]: The temperature of the surrounding air measured in Kelvin.
5. Process Temperature [K]: The temperature of the manufacturing process measured in Kelvin.
6. Rotational Speed [rpm]: The speed at which the device rotates, measured in revolutions per minute.
7. Torque [Nm]: The torque applied to the device, measured in Newton meters.
8. Tool Wear [min]: The duration of tool usage, measured in minutes.
9. Target (Machine Failure): An indicator of whether the machine has failed or not (Yes/No).
10. Failure Type: Specifies the type of failure encountered.

## Proposed Project:

The project follows a structured approach, encompassing the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather historical data from industrial devices, clean, and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Identify relevant features from the collected data to predict potential failures or maintenance needs.

3. **Model Development:** Develop predictive maintenance models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, support vector machine, and neural network.

4. **Integration and Deployment:** Integrate the developed models into existing infrastructure for real-time monitoring and provide alerts or recommendations to maintenance personnel.

## Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis:

Thorough data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis were conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Steps included:

- Data loading and overview
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including visualization of numerical features, correlation analysis, and analysis of categorical features.
- Feature engineering to create new features based on domain knowledge.
- Data preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and high cardinality features.

## Model Training and Prediction:

Selected machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to predict machine failures accurately. Models included logistic regression, random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, support vector machine, and neural network.

## Model Selection and Deployment:

The best-performing model(s) will be selected for deployment in production environments. Continuous monitoring and model refinement will be conducted to ensure optimal performance.

## Conclusion:

This project aims to develop accurate and reliable predictive maintenance models to reduce downtime, minimize costs, and enhance operational efficiency in industrial settings.
